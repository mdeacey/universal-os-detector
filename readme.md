# Universal OS Detector

Universal OS Detector is a Bash script designed to provide detailed information about the system itâ€™s running on. It aims to detect a broad range of operating systems, system architectures, kernel versions, and container environments, ensuring compatibility with as many systems as possible. The script is built to run effectively across different systems, providing universal detection capabilities.

## Features

- Detects operating system
- Identifies system architecture
- Reports kernel version
- Checks for container environments (Docker, LXC, OpenVZ)
- Comprehensive logging with color-coded output
- Error handling and cleanup procedures

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `uni_os_detect.sh` script.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x uni_os_detect.sh
   ```

## Usage and Examples

Run the script with:

```
./uni_os_detect.sh
```

The script provides information about:
- Container environment (if applicable)
- Operating System
- System Architecture
- Kernel Version

### Basic Usage

When run without any options, the script outputs only the system information:

```
$ ./uni_os_detect.sh
2024-09-17 14:14:15 [SYSTEM]: Not running inside a container
2024-09-17 14:14:15 [SYSTEM]: Operating System: MacOS
2024-09-17 14:14:15 [SYSTEM]: Architecture: x86_64 (64-bit)
2024-09-17 14:14:15 [SYSTEM]: Kernel: 23.6.0
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see detailed logging of the script's operations:

```
$ DEBUG_MODE=1 ./uni_os_detect.sh

```

### Custom Log File

Specify a custom log file path:

```
LOG_FILE=/path/to/custom.log ./uni_os_detect.sh
```

Output is logged to the specified log file and, depending on the debug mode, displayed in the console with color-coded messages for different log levels.

## Integrating with Other Scripts

You can easily incorporate the Universal OS Detector into your own scripts with the following one-liner:

```bash
source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdeacey/universal-os-detector/main/universal-os-detector.sh) && run_detection
```

Alternatively, you can use `wget`:

```bash
source <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdeacey/universal-os-detector/main/universal-os-detector.sh) && run_detection
```

This command fetches the script from GitHub, sources it, and executes the `run_detection` function, which performs all detection operations and logs the results.

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- Standard Unix utilities: uname, tr, grep
